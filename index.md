**Welcome the Swiss ISA Hub** 

Disclaimer: Not (yet) officially affiliated with ISA (International Society of Automation).

The **Swiss ISA Hub** is a newly founded local initiative bringing together professionals, students, and organizations with a shared interest in industrial automation and control systems (IACS) security, standards, and innovation.  
Our focus is on promoting awareness, knowledge exchange, and adoption of the **ISA/IEC 62443** series and related best practices across Swiss industries such as energy, water, manufacturing, pharma, and broadcast.

## Our Mission

As a community, we aim to:

- Build a neutral platform for networking and collaboration.  
- Support local companies in aligning with global ISA/IEC standards.  
- Foster education and career growth through workshops, study groups, and events.  
- Connect Switzerland with the broader ISA Europe and global ISA community.
